# Tic-Tac-Toe

To play my version of Tic-Tac-Toe, you can visit the following link: [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://papa-fish.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe, or Naughts and Crosses. It is a two-player game planned on a 3x3 board. The players take turns making spaces on the board with their respective symbols ('X' - player one, 'O' - player two) with the objective of getting three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
